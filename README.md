# Rock-Paper-Scissors
A simple game of Rock Paper Scissors v3.0 <br/>
Major improvements over the versions:
1. **V1**: Core logic, a CLI based rock paper scissors game. Born because i was bored and wanted to play the game but no one was around. ðŸ¥‰ <br/> 
2. **V2**: A simple GUI based game. Born because i couldn't really find anything like it. ðŸ¥ˆ <br/>
3. **V3**: Contains music and much better animations. ðŸ¥‡<br/>
<br/>
Note: that I have not added the v1 and v2 as v3 is superior to both of them in every single way. 

## Installation
Please install python packages listed in the requirements.txt using the standard method. (pip install -r requirements.txt)

## How to Setup?

1. If you are using python:<br/><br/>
  a. Install python 3.5+ <br/>
  b. Perform installaton of requirements stated in requirements.txt. To do this: <br/>
  <code>pip install -r ./reqiurements.txt </code><br/>
  c. Run the main file using python.<br/>
  <code>python ./Rock_Paper_Scissors_v3.py</code><br/>
<br/>
2. Alternatively, use the release version in the tags section of this repo for a windows install.

## How to play?

1. Run the game (refer above)<br/>
2. Once running, wait for the loading to screen to get over. (Not required really, all the resources load instantly. It's just something to practise sprite loading) <br/>
3.  Press the "END" key to start the game and to play again. <br/>
4.  The logic of selection is random, every press of "END" key is honored, so be careful!<br/>
5.  Alternatively, a README.txt is provided in the windows release tag. 

## So what can i upgrade?

The stock code comes with a custom font and some gif images that i have split into component images. These are fully customizable (all of them). Just remember to name them according to the existing structure and you should be fine.<br/>
Simultaneously, you can alter the music files provided in the /music folder, just remember to rename the new file to the orignal one.<br>
<br/>
### Improvements
<br>
Yes, there are multiple points of improvements possible, like allowing user to change screen WHILE a gif is executed, dropping the multiple "END" key press in case of spamming the button and the save the application from crashing. Fork it and go crazy ðŸ‘½
